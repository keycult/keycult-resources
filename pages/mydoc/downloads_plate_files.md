## Plate Files

Many people have asked for plate files for past Keycult keyboards for their own personal use. We've chosen to release them below with a limited, non-commercial license. **Please understand that by downloading these files, you're agreeing to these terms of use:**

* **Non-commercial**: These files may only be used for personal, non-commercial purposes, unless express, written permission has been granted by Keycult. Group Buys are considered as commercial.

* **Modifications**: You may modify these files as you wish for your personal use, but you may not use them as the foundation for a commercial project. Keycult will not provide modifications or adjustments to the files.

* **No warranty provided**: Keycult provides no warranty for these files. You agree to take full responsibility for their use.

With that out of the way, plate files can be downloaded below.
