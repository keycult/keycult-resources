## Keycult Raffle Info, Tips & Troubleshooting 
Starting in August 2020, Keycult is using a new raffle system integrated with our Discord chat server. Important links:

The purpose of this document is to answer common questions and provide useful troubleshooting tips to those who might be having trouble.


## General raffle rules

These rules apply to all raffles conducted by Keycult. Failure to abide by them may get you disqualified, banned, or blacklisted from future raffles and releases.

- You have 12 hours to enter on raffle day (10am to 10pm EDT) and **cannot change your configuration after you submit!** Please be sure of your submission and take your time.
- One entry per person. If we are running multiple raffles at the same time, you may enter each one once.
- You may not enter on behalf of someone else or agree ahead of time to sell your slot to someone else if you win.
- If you win, you will receive an invoice through our Shopify storefront and will have 24 hours to complete payment. **We do not accept PayPal.**
