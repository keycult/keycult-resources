                                If selected you get a notification via discord and email that you won a drawing. You can then visit the drawing’s product page and select the configuration you’d like EX: A/B stock, hotswap/solderable PCB, etc.

                              If there is no longer any stock of a particular configuration, you’ll see it right there on the page with the option grayed out. If that is a deal breaker, you can let the win go and have increased odds rolled into our next drawing.
