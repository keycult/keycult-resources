## Changelog

### No. 1/60 and 1/65 Rev. 1

Much like the TKL release in June, this release is a revision to the original. While the plates are compatible, no other case components are. We've taken the lessons learned from a year of designing and producing keyboards and wrapped them up in this revision. Changes include:

- PTFE plate-alignment pins
- Leaf-spring plate for added flex
- VIA-compatible WT60-A and USB-C daughterboard designed by Wilba
