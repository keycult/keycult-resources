## Changelog

### No. 2 Rev. 1

Unlike the No. 1 Rev. 1, this revision to the No. 2 is very minor, largely to address feedback from customers. Changes include:

- Minor changes to internals and clearances
- New plate design for increased flex (compatible with original release, details TBA)
- Case height increased slightly so that keycaps appear to sit lower in the case (actual height from desk to plate is unchanged)
- New custom-molded silicone bumpon feet (compatible with original release)

### Build Guide

Check out the teardown on Youtube! Just keep in mind this is for the OG No. 2 TKL. See changelog above for differences.
