**How do I join the raffle?**
https://raffle.keycult.com/ - You must have a verified discord account, with a linked phone number, to participate in our raffles. Authentication happens through Discord, so if you are able to successfully chat in this Discord server, you can enter the raffle. Raffle links will be posted in #announcements with plenty of time in advance.

**How do I verify my phone number with Discord?**
To verify your phone number, you must enable Two-Factor Authentication and then add your phone as an SMS Backup. Learn more here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication

If you're getting an "Invalid Phone Number" error, see here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000961212-Invalid-Phone-Number

**Can people from the same household enter?**
Yes, as long as they actually want one.

**What kind of information do I need to enter?**
All you need is your Discord login information to authenticate with the raffle platform. You also need to know your preferences for the current raffle you want to enter (layout, color, material, extras)

**When I enter a raffle, what email is used?**
When you login to the raffle page, your email connected to your discord account will be listed. This is the one we will use for invoicing. If this email is incorrect, please update your email address with Discord before entering the raffle. Once you enter the raffle, you email cannot be changed.

**Does Keycult use any of this information for anything else?**
No, Keycult does not use any of the information (like your email address) for anything but notifying you about the current raffle. You will not be subscribed to any mailing list.

**I am unable to authenticate on the raffle website. How can I fix this:**
Here are a few good troubleshooting steps and things to check:
- Make sure you are logging into the correct Discord account
- Make sure the Discord account you are logging into has a verified phone number, and has access to post in the Keycult Discord
- Clear your cache/cookies
- Try a different browser

**Will I need a credit/debit card to enter the raffle?**
No. To enter the raffle you do not need your credit or debit card. If you are chosen in a raffle, you will then need your credit/debit card to pay your invoice.
