## Changelog

### No. 1 Rev. 2

The No. 1 Rev. 2 is a small revision to the No. 1 design, adding a few quality of life changes.

- A new leaf-spring plate adds a bit of additional flex to the typing experience 
- PTFE locating pins solve the problem of plate alignment during assembly. The plate is backwards-compatible with last year's No. 1 Rev. 1, though the locating pins are not. 

### No. 1 Rev. 1

Revision 1 was a complete, ground-up redesign of the original No. 1. No parts are compatible, including the plate. Major changes include:

- VIA-compatible PCB and daughterboard placed in the base of the keyboard (instead of TX87 PCB)
- Shallower typing angle (8° instead of 9.5°)
- Lower height from desk to plate
- Refined aesthetics (smoother & better-proportioned curves)

## Build Guide
Checkout the teardown on Youtube! Just keep in mind this is for the No. 1 Rev. 1. See changelog above for differences.
