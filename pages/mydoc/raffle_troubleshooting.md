## Issues authenticating on raffle.keycult.com

Problem: You have created a Discord account but are unable to successfully authenticate on <https://raffle.keycult.com>.

Steps to take:

1. Ensure you have joined the Keycult Discord server at <https://discord.gg/keycult>
2. Ensure that you have agreed to our Server Rules by completing the Discord onboarding for the server. If you see the message below, please click the blue "Complete" button and agree to the rules.

3. Ensure that you have DM's enabled for members of the Keycult server.
4. Log out on <https://raffle.keycult.com> and log back in with your Discord account.




## Confirming access to raffles

There are a few ways to check:

1. If you have the `Verified` role in the Keycult Discord server, you should be good to go.
2. If you can send messages in the Keycult Discord server, you should be good to go.
3. If you can authenticate and see either the raffle or the “No raffles currently available” message on <https://raffle.keycult.com>, you should be good to go.


## Can't see the raffle? "Looks like we're not currently running any raffles"

Try a hard-refresh using `Ctrl-Shift-R`.
