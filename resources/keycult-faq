## Keycult FAQ

Hi there! A lot of common questions can be answered by reading this FAQ. If you have a question not listed here, feel free to pop over to #discussion and start a conversation!

**Will the WTXX PCB fit a non Keycult keyboard?** 
These PCB's are designed to work with Keycult keyboards, and probably will not fit other cases. If buying for another case, make sure it will fit.

**Are plate files available?**
Yes, for non-commercial, personal use. You can find them here: https://keycult.com/resources#plates

**How do I program my PCB?**
Keycult PCBs are programmed using VIA, a desktop application that allows on-the-fly key-remapping without having to flash your PCB. You can download the latest release and learn more at https://caniusevia.com/

**Can you explain the naming of your keyboards, what is the difference between No. 1 / No. 2 / No .1/65, etc.**
Keycult keyboards are all named off their design language and their formfactor. The three current design languages are the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. Each has its own aesthetics, qualities, and differences. The default for each design language is a TKL, meaning that a “No. 1” is the No. 1 design language in a TKL form factor. A “No. 1/65” is the No. 1 design language, in a 65% formfactor. 

**What current designs / form factors exist?**
Currently the following exist:
No. 1
No. 1/65
No. 1/60
No. 2
No. 2/65
No. 3 (Unreleased)

**What do the revision numbers mean?**
Each time we tweak a design, that is considered a new revision. These changes might be small, or large. 

Past revisions:

No.1 Rev. 2 (Released June 2020):
https://keycult.com/pages/no-1-rev2-preorder-information
The No. 1 Rev. 2 is a small revision to the No. 1 design, adding a few quality of life changes. 
+ A new leaf-spring plate adds a bit of additional flex to the typing experience 
+ PTFE locating pins solve the problem of plate alignment during assembly. The plate is backwards-compatible with last year's No. 1 Rev. 1, though the locating pins are not. 

No. 1 Rev. 1 (Released June 2019):
https://keycult.com/pages/about-the-no-1-rev-1
Revision 1 was a complete, ground-up redesign of the original No. 1. No parts are compatible, including the plate. Major changes include:
+ VIA-compatible PCB and daughterboard placed in the base of the keyboard (instead of TX87 PCB)
+ Shallower typing angle (8° instead of 9.5°)
+ Lower height from desk to plate
+ Refined aesthetics (smoother & better-proportioned curves)

No .1/65 and No. 1/60 Rev. 1 (Released December 2019):
https://keycult.com/pages/no-1-60-rev-1-and-no-1-65-rev-1-preorder-information
Much like the TKL release in June, this release is a revision to the original. While the plates are compatible, no other case components are. We've taken the lessons learned from a year of designing and producing keyboards and wrapped them up in this revision. Changes include:
+ PTFE plate-alignment pins
+ Leaf-spring plate for added flex
+ VIA-compatible WT60-A and USB-C daughterboard designed by Wilba

No .2 Rev. 1 (Released July 2019):
https://keycult.com/pages/no-2-rev-1-preorder-information
Unlike the No. 1 Rev. 1, this revision to the No. 2 is very minor, largely to address feedback from customers. Changes include:
+ Minor changes to internals and clearances
+ New plate design for increased flex (compatible with original release, details TBA)
+ Case height increased slightly so that keycaps appear to sit lower in the case (actual height from desk to plate is unchanged)
+ New custom-molded silicone bumpon feet (compatible with original release)

**How do I clean the board?** For anodized aluminum and brass parts, its recommended to use some warm water and a drop or two of soap.

**How do I remove brass tarnish?** Step 1. Embrace the tarnish. Step 2. If tarnish still bothers you, repeat step 1.

## General FAQ

**How do I even buy one of these?**
We’ve written about this here: https://keycult.com/pages/how-to-buy

**When will X be available again?**
We have a tentative release schedule available here: https://keycult.com/schedule

**Can I pay with PayPal?**
No, Keycult no longer accepts PayPal for purchases made through our store. This is for two reasons: 1) PayPal has changed its policy in regards to refunds to not return PayPal fees if a refund is issued. We believe this is anti-consumer and anti-business. 2) PayPal has become increasingly heavy-handed in enforcing its long-standing policy against any preorder that takes longer than 20 days to fulfill, potentially jeopardizing our account if we allow PayPal for preorder payments.

We accept all major credit cards as well as debit/bank cards that have a major credit card's logo on them (acquired from nearly every major bank).

**Will the plate from different designs fit each other? (Ex: Will a No. 2 plate fit a No. 1?)**
No the plates are not compatible

**What is your live update stream schedule?**
Unless otherwise mentioned, all live updates will take plates on every other Thursday at 4pm Eastern time. Feel free to join us at https://twitch.tv/keycult for our other streams as well.

**When will plates for X be restocked? When will PCBs be restocked?**
We try to maintain a steady inventory of PCBs and plates available for our boards. If a PCB or plate is out of stock now, it'll be restocked in the near future.

**When will 60% and 65% hotswap PCBs be available?**
Hot-swap PCBs are in the works, and will be available in the future!
